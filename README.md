# worcester-lang

The most annoying programming language.
Read GRAMMAR.md for tutorial.
Written in Rust for speed, but at this point, does it even really matter?
Named after the most challenging word to pronounce.

### About

<!-- LLaMa3.2 wrote the About + Reminder section because lazy. -->

Worcester-Lang (WCL) is a side project created by two passionate developers who aim to craft a programming language that will test your patience, challenge your sanity, and make you wonder why you even bothered learning it in the first place. Our goal is to create a unique and frustrating experience for every programmer who dares to try it out.
Worcester-Lang is not for the faint of heart. It's a language that requires dedication, perseverance, and a strong stomach. If you're looking for a language to help you learn programming concepts, look elsewhere. But if you're feeling brave and want to push your limits, then Worcester-Lang may be the perfect choice for you.

Our language features a unique blend of complex syntax, obtuse semantics, and a healthy dose of randomness. It's not uncommon for a single line of code to produce unexpected results or crash your entire program. But that's all part of the fun!

When working with Worcester-Lang, keep in mind that things rarely are as they seem.
Pay close attention to every detail, no matter how small, and be prepared to debug for hours on end.

### Eso-Language Disclaimer

Worcester-Lang is an Eso-Language (eso-lang), designed to provide a humorous and frustrating experience for programmers. It's not meant to be taken seriously or used for actual development. This language is all about testing the limits of human patience and understanding, so don't even think about trying to use it for anything productive.

Designed to be an actually tolerable eso-lang that isn't difficult like Brainfuck, but kind of just an annoyance.
