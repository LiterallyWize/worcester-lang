### A very irritating programming language, named after a very irritating word to pronounce.

Guide can be found in [GRAMMAR.md](GRAMMAR.md).

## About
Worcester-Lang (WCL) is an [esoteric language (esolang)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Syntax obtuse, semantics unclear, Worcester-Lang is not for the faint of heart.
Our language aims to alienate users familiar with other languages, with unusual and redundant grammar, as well as a not-so-healthy dose of pseudo-random bullshit, sure to make you regret ever thinking about using it.

## Your arch nemesis
Enter **Worcest**, our mascot and your enemy throughout your experience. His goal is to insult you, sabotage you, and *literally* make you beg for him not to fuck up your program as it runs.

## More...

### Disclaimer: We have nothing to do with the city of [Worcester, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts), we are named after [Worcestershire Sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_sauce)

You can find some pre-written scripts demonstrating the language in `worcester-lang/experiments`.
